Welcome to the internal documentation for Collective Biographies of Women (CBW). If you aren't involved in the development of the project, you're in the wrong place â€“ but feel free to check out [the project](http://cbw.iath.virginia.edu/) if you're curious!

If you're a new research assistant for CBW, read the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT0A-u0BusPzknzC8tNu9-zbe-UvtA00B8fmnHBqwtSM5HGlQJoZHXGL8V7Us4yXlq9bGiZeuq-U9Q3/pub) first. The glossary might help if you need more information on a term, or if you want links to outside resources.
